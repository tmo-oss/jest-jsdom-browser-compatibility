# Overview

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity. And it is more and more popular because of simple and better engineer productivity.

Compared to the conventional Javascript test runner [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) + [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), Jest is much more lightweight and faster. It has the following benifits:

- Headless browser environment: No need to open the real browsers as what Karma does, it saves much more time.
- Possible to run multiple tests in parallel: benefit from the lightweight of the headless browser environment.
- [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing), a useful feature which is not available in Jasmine
- Easier to use
  - CLI: filter by a filename or test name regex pattern (reducing the need for fdescribe) and rerun tests
  - Low configuration needed to get started
  - Clear documentation which makes it easy to adjust Jest to your needs
  - Testing is stable: no more sudden test runner failures while writing tests

So we want to migrate our tests from Karma + Jasmine to Jest.

However, the headless browser of Jest is not the real browser, it is based on the [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom), and it has still some compatibility issues. In this project, we explored all the compatibility issues and summarize them as a comparison Matrix. It will be a good reference for anyone who wants to migrate tests to Jest.

In this project, we provided 65 test cases, each test case provides a stand-alone in Angular 7 to demonstrate the compatibility issues of JSDOM.

# Prerequisite

- NPM or yarn
- Git
- Safari, Chrome, Firefox

# How to run each test case

1. Click the link in the following comparison matrix to see the source code of each test case.
2. Follow the README of the test case source code to run the test.
